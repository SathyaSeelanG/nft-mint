Chia Blockchain NFT Minting Script
This project is a Node.js script that automates the minting of NFTs on the Chia blockchain. It interacts with the Chia blockchain CLI through PowerShell, fetches NFT metadata and image data from URLs, calculates hashes, and executes minting commands to create NFTs with royalties.

Features
Automated NFT Minting: Mint NFTs using Chia CLI.
Royalty Address and Percentage: Set a royalty address and royalty percentage for minted NFTs.
Image and Metadata Hashing: Automatically fetches the image and metadata URLs, computes their SHA-256 hashes, and includes them in the minting process.
PowerShell Integration: Executes the necessary Chia CLI commands through PowerShell.
Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

Chia Blockchain: The Chia blockchain must be installed and set up on your machine. Follow the official Chia installation guide here.
Node.js: This project is built using Node.js. Install Node.js from the official website here.
PowerShell: PowerShell is required to execute the Chia CLI commands. Make sure it's available in your environment.
Setup
Clone this repository:

bash

Install dependencies: Install the required Node.js modules by running the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Chia Wallet Setup: Ensure your Chia wallet is set up, and the wallet fingerprint, NFT address, and royalty address are correct. You'll need your Chia wallet to mint the NFTs.

Chia Blockchain Setup:

Activate your Chia virtual environment by running the following command in PowerShell:
powershell
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Ensure that the Chia blockchain software is properly installed and synced.
Configuration
Before running the script, update the following variables in the index.js file:

javascript
Copy code

walletIndex: The wallet index you are using in your Chia wallet (typically 0 or 1 for the default wallet).
royaltyAddress: The address that will receive royalties for the NFT sale.
nftAddress: The address where the minted NFTs will be stored.
royaltyPercent: The royalty percentage. For example, 500 represents a 2.5% royalty.
walletFingerprint: The fingerprint of your Chia wallet.
fee: The transaction fee for minting each NFT.
Running the Script
Once you have set up your environment and configured the variables, run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
node mint.js
This will start the process of minting NFTs. The script will:

Navigate to the Chia Blockchain directory.
Activate the virtual environment.
Fetch image and metadata URLs for the NFTs.
Compute the SHA-256 hashes of the image and metadata.
Mint the NFT using the Chia CLI and set the royalty details.
The script will continue running and mint NFTs in a loop, incrementing the nftId with each iteration. You can modify the starting and maximum NFT ID values in the script.

Customizing the Minting Process
You can customize the following parts of the script:

Image and Metadata URLs: The URLs for the image and metadata files for each NFT can be modified by changing the nftImageUrl and nftJsonUrl variables.

Minting Interval: The script runs in a loop every 2 minutes (120000 milliseconds). You can adjust the interval by changing the interval variable.

Troubleshooting
PowerShell Execution Policy: If you encounter an error when running PowerShell scripts, you may need to change the execution policy. Run the following command in PowerShell with Administrator privileges:

powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Chia CLI Issues: Ensure that the Chia Blockchain software is installed correctly and fully synced.
